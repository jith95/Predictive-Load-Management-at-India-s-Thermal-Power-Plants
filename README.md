# Predictive-Load-Management-at-India-s-Thermal-Power-Plants
This project was a part of the ES654(Machine Learning) course at IIT Gandhinagar, Spring 2019 <br>
The energy demand prediction across India's thermal power plants was made using various time series forecasting methods. <br>
Data from 2013-2018 (https://posoco.in/reports/daily-reports/) was used to train our models which predicted for the year 2019.
